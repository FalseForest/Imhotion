  Thanks to my father, I got to know a car dealer that repairs old-timers. He
  had very exclusive cars like one of Hitler and one of a king in Africa.


   


  After we got to know him, we showed him some of my movies and he wanted one too as there were three super exclusive Porsche's coming over.

  ## Behind The Scenes




  Since the cars were **vintage cars**, they couldn't drive very fast and the engines couldn't make much noise. Still, I wanted to make it a short and very fast film.


   


  So by **speeding up** the videos and **adding sounds** from other cars, I've achieved a surreal yet unique vintage car film.
