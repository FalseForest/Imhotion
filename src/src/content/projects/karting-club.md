  ## Behind The Scenes


  **Every aspect of this video was meticulously crafted** to transform the original Karting circuit into a lifelike virtual 3D world, while still capturing the essence of a video game and revolutionizing the perception of Tenerife through this remarkable production.


  â€‹


  **To accurately depict the featured Kart**, the CRG CENTURION, I had the privilege of obtaining the original blueprints from CRG. These blueprints served as a valuable reference as I meticulously developed the 3D model of the Kart.


  **Among the various** captivating shots in the video, my personal favorite is the slow-motion sequence. This particular shot was of utmost importance as it presented a unique opportunity to capture a moment that would be incredibly challenging, if not impossible, to film with a conventional camera. This decision added a distinct utility to employing this technique, elevating the overall impact of the video.






  **In order to establish a genuine connection** and enhance the sense of realism for viewers, I chose to incorporate a real person into the promotional video. This approach allowed individuals to forge a personal connection rather than feeling distant in a purely virtual environment. In this particular scene, I combined real-life footage of Imhotep Vandeputte's face with a meticulously designed 3D helmet, seamlessly merging the person with the virtual world.
